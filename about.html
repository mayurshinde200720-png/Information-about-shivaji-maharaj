<h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
<p>
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1630–1680) was a legendary Indian warrior king
and the founder of the Maratha Empire. He was born at the Shivneri Fort
near Pune. From a young age, he showed exceptional leadership,
courage, and strategic thinking.
</p>
<p>
Guided by his mother Jijabai and mentor Dadaji Kondadev, Shivaji Maharaj
developed a strong sense of justice and the dream of establishing a
Swarajya — a self-ruled kingdom for the people.
</p>
<h2>Leadership & Achievements</h2>
<p>
He built a powerful navy, reformed military tactics, and introduced a
progressive administrative system. His use of guerrilla warfare,
innovative war strategies, and construction of strong forts across the
Western Ghats made him one of the greatest kings in Indian history.
</p>
<h2>Coronation</h2>
<p>
On 6 June 1674, Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as the Chhatrapati at
Raigad Fort — marking the formal beginning of the Maratha Empire.
